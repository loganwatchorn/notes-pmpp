# Welcome
Hi there,

Over the next few months, I'll be reading **Programming Massively Parallel Processors** by Hwu, Kirk, and Hajj.

I'll be posting my notes here as I go along. I hope it helps anyone who shares my interest in parallel computation!

Happy learning!

# Running CUDA Code
I'll be using Google Colab to start out. Will set up an environment and put instructions here by the end of reading chapter 2.
