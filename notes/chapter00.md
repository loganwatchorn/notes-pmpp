# Chapter 0: Preface

The text will use CUDA C, supported by NVIDIA GPUs.

## New in the 4th edition
This is the 4th edition text, published in 2023. Since the 3rd edition (2016), there have been three new generations of GPU computing architectures:
- Volta
- Turing
- Ampere

There have also been new CUDA versions: 9 through 11.

The new edition has been re-organized and extended. There are 4 new chapters:
- Chapter 4 (Compute Architecture and Scheduling)
- Chapter 8 (Stencil pattern)
- Chapter 10 (Reduction and Minimizing Divergence)
- Chapter 13 (Sorting)

## Organization
The book's chapters are organized into 4 parts:
1. Part I: Fundamental concepts behind parallel programming
2. Part II: Using fundamental concepts in six computation patterns
3. Additional advanced patterns & applications
4. Advanced practices and programming features

## How to use the book
This book was designed to be covered by one course in one semester. Most chapters fit in a single 75 minute lecture, some in two (11, 14, 15).

Finishing parts 1 and 2 would take the first 7 weeks of the semester.
